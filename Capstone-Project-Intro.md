# New York neighborhood and Covid poisitive numbers
## Introduction/Business Problem
There has been a re-emergence of Covid-19 in New York area this fall after an initial wave of high infection rate during the summer. This project attempts to compare venues in various New York neighborhoods having high and low new Covid-19 positive numbers during November 15-22, 2020. It can help to know if neighborhoods with certain categories of venues show high or low Covid-19 new positive rate or if the new positive rate is independent of types of venues in a neighborhood. The information can be used by local authorities to implement stricter measures for controlling the spread of infection in high frequency venue categories with high new positive rate. It can be used by neighborhood residents to avoid visits or take more precaution while visiting common venues in high new positive rate neighborhoods.

Although out of scope for current project, the analysis can be extended to Covid-19 positive numbers from past weeks (including those in summer) and/or neighborhoods in additional US/global cities.
